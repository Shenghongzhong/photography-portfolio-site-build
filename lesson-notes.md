 # The story of HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
 
 In the late 1980s, there was a laboratory called CERN in Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, was working there and invented this markup language.
 Probably he couldn't bear with the inaccessability of miscommunication between each machine. So he invented this language as well as a browser. 
 Then, he can read documentation anywhere.
